  <h1>Privacy Policy for [Your App Name]</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Your App Name] (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> We collect your Google Advertising ID (AAID) when you use the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> This identifier is used by Google Mobile Ads SDK to serve you personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> When you open the App, the Google Mobile Ads SDK automatically retrieves your AAID to request ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Device and Usage Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> Basic device details such as device model, operating system version, screen size, and App version.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure compatibility, measure performance, and optimize the user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> Collected automatically when you launch or use the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Payment Information (Razorpay)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> When you purchase a background image (or any in-App purchase) via Razorpay, we collect:
      <ul>
        <li>Your email address (to send a receipt and confirm delivery of digital content).</li>
        <li>Transaction ID and timestamp.</li>
        <li>Partial billing address (only the data needed by Razorpay to process payment; we do not store your full card details).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> To process your purchase, send invoices or receipts, and ensure delivery of the digital asset you bought.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> Payment is handled through Razorpay’s secure, PCI-compliant payment gateway. Razorpay collects your payment details (like card number or UPI information). We receive only the transaction confirmation and minimal buyer data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personalize and Serve Ads:</strong> We use your Advertising ID to let Google Mobile Ads display targeted advertisements. Neither we nor Google collect personally identifiable information beyond the AAID for this purpose. You can reset or opt out of ads personalization at any time via your Android Settings: Android Settings → Google → Ads → “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”</li>
    <li><strong>Process In-App Purchases:</strong> When you buy a background image through Razorpay, we receive a confirmation containing your email and purchase ID. We use this to:
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver the purchased content within the App.</li>
        <li>Send you an email receipt (if you provide an email).</li>
        <li>Resolve any payment disputes or refund requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>App Stability & Performance (Optional – if you use Crashlytics or Analytics):</strong> If we use Firebase Crashlytics (or any crash-reporting/analytics service), we collect crash logs and basic usage metrics (screen views, session duration, feature interactions) to improve stability. This data does <em>not</em> identify you personally. This collection is anonymous and used only for debugging and product improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Support & Communication:</strong> If you contact us for support (e.g., regarding a failed payment or app issue), we will use the information you provide (such as your email address) to reply to your inquiry. We may send you transactional emails related to your purchase or account status but we will not send unsolicited marketing emails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google (Ads &amp; Firebase, if used):</strong> We share your Advertising ID with Google’s Mobile Ads SDK so ads can be targeted. If we use Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics, we share anonymous crash logs and usage data with Google to monitor app health and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Razorpay:</strong> To process payments, we share minimal buyer data (email, transaction amount) with Razorpay. All sensitive payment information (card details, UPI, etc.) is processed and stored on Razorpay’s servers under their PCI-compliant environment. We do <em>not</em> store full card numbers, CVV, or PIN.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Enforcement or Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose your data if required by law, court order, or governmental regulation. We will inform you unless legally prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may engage third-party vendors for crash reporting, analytics, or email delivery. These vendors receive only the data necessary to perform their services and are contractually obligated to keep it confidential.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention &amp; User Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> We do not store your AAID beyond the session where ads are requested. It is automatically managed by Google’s SDK.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Records:</strong> We retain transaction confirmations (purchase ID, timestamp, and buyer email) for up to 2 years to handle refunds, transaction disputes, or customer support.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash &amp; Analytics Data (if used):</strong> Stored on Google’s servers for up to 14 months (Firebase default) or as configured by our analytics settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4.1 How You Can Control or Delete Your Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> You can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads at any time by going to Android Settings → Google → Ads → “Reset advertising ID” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Data:</strong> If you wish to remove your purchase history from our records or request deletion of your email, please contact us at <code>privacy@kaleriabhishek.com</code>. We will comply within a reasonable timeframe unless legally required to retain certain records (e.g., for tax or audit purposes).</li>
    <li><strong>General Deletion Requests:</strong> To request deletion of any personal data (email, user profile, etc.) you provided, email <code>privacy@kaleriabhishek.com</code> with “Data Deletion Request” in the subject line. We will acknowledge within 3 business days and complete the deletion within 30 days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data exchanges between the App and our servers (if any) use SSL/TLS encryption. This ensures that sensitive information—like your Advertising ID or purchase confirmations—is securely transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> All payment data (card numbers, UPI, etc.) is handled exclusively on Razorpay’s PCI-compliant infrastructure. We never see or store your full payment details.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Any data we store is protected behind secure authentication. Only authorized personnel have access to backup files and logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is <strong>not intended</strong> for use by children under 13. We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information from any child under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at <code>privacy@kaleriabhishek.com</code> so we can delete that data.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Links or SDKs</h2>
  <p>Our App may contain links to external websites or use third-party SDKs (e.g., Google Mobile Ads SDK, Razorpay SDK). We do <strong>not control</strong> how those third parties collect, use, or disclose your data. We recommend reviewing each third party’s privacy policy for details.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time, especially if we add new features (such as analytics or social logins). When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top. If we make material changes (e.g., changing how payment data is used), we will notify you by posting a notice in the App or sending you an email if you’ve already made a purchase.</p>
