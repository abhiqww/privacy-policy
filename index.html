  <h1>Privacy Policy for Emoji Fall</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong>08-06-2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Emoji Fall (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the terms described below.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> We collect your Google Advertising ID (AAID) when you use the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> This identifier is used by Google Mobile Ads SDK to serve you personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> When you open the App, the Google Mobile Ads SDK automatically retrieves your AAID to request ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Device and Usage Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> Basic device details such as device model, operating system version, screen size, and App version.</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure compatibility, measure performance, and optimize the user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> Collected automatically when you launch or use the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Payment Information (Google Play Billing)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What:</strong> When you purchase a background image or any in-app content via Google Play Billing, the transaction is processed by Google Play. We receive:
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase token and product ID</li>
        <li>Transaction timestamp</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> To verify your purchase, deliver the purchased content within the App, and handle refunds or support requests.</li>
    <li><strong>How:</strong> The purchase is handled through Google Play’s secure payment system. We do not receive or store any full payment details (e.g., credit card numbers, UPI information).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personalize and Serve Ads:</strong> We use your Advertising ID to let Google Mobile Ads display targeted advertisements. Neither we nor Google collect personally identifiable information beyond the AAID for this purpose. You can reset or opt out of ads personalization at any time in Android Settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Process In-App Purchases:</strong> When you make an in-app purchase through Google Play Billing, we use the purchase token and product ID to:
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver the purchased content within the App.</li>
        <li>Verify purchase status and handle refunds or disputes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support & Communication:</strong> If you contact us for support (e.g., regarding a failed purchase or app issue), we will use the information you provide (such as your email address) to reply to your inquiry. We may send you transactional emails related to your purchase but will not send unsolicited marketing emails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google (Ads):</strong> We share your Advertising ID with Google’s Mobile Ads SDK so ads can be targeted.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play (In-App Purchases):</strong> To verify and process in-app purchases, we share the purchase token and product ID with Google Play. We do not share any personal payment information beyond what is needed to fulfill the purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>Law Enforcement or Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose your data if required by law, court order, or governmental regulation. We will inform you unless legally prohibited.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may engage third-party vendors for ads delivery or email support. These vendors receive only the data necessary to perform their services and are contractually obligated to keep it confidential.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention &amp; User Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> We do not store your AAID beyond the session where ads are requested. It is automatically managed by Google’s SDK.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Records:</strong> We retain minimal transaction details (purchase token, product ID, and timestamp) for up to 2 years to handle refunds, transaction disputes, or customer support.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4.1 How You Can Control or Delete Your Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> You can reset your Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads at any time in Android Settings → Google → Ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Data:</strong> If you wish to remove your purchase records, please contact us at <code>privacy@kaleriabhishek.com</code>. We will comply within a reasonable timeframe unless legally required to retain certain records.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> All data exchanges between the App and our servers (if any) use SSL/TLS encryption. This ensures that sensitive information is securely transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> All in-app purchase data is handled exclusively by Google Play’s secure infrastructure. We never see or store your full payment details.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Any data we store is protected behind secure authentication. Only authorized personnel have access to backup files and logs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is <strong>not intended</strong> for use by children under 13. We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information from any child under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at <code>kaleruabhishek123@gmail.com</code> so we can delete that data.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Links or SDKs</h2>
  <p>Our App may contain links to external websites or use third-party SDKs (e.g., Google Mobile Ads SDK). We do <strong>not control</strong> how those third parties collect, use, or disclose your data. We recommend reviewing each third party’s privacy policy for details.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time, especially if we add new features. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting a notice in the App or sending you an email if you’ve already made a purchase.</p>
